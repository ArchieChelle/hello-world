# hello-world
My first repository




Hi fellow Gitians!

*looks around Github*

Thank for receiving me in such fashion. My name is Chelle, and I know I'm not the first of my kind here.
I'm a self-taught Data scientist/UX researcher looking to build my toolbox. My boyfriend has been speaking
in Git for the last year we've been dating, so I decided to make it easier on myself and learn version control.

Wish me luck. And YG, don't say I never did anything for us!
